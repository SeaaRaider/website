# Simple site with weather

## My own website, with basic flexboxes and GET weather API from openweather.

This is site I made thanks to knowledge gained from online courses on YouTube and Udemy. Its purpose is to give an example what I have learned so far about HTML, CSS, JS and API.
This site includes:

* Simple JavaScript clock script
* Flexible divisions
* Basic API displaying current weather, temperature and humidity in any given city in Poland

## The future

As I will gain experience and expand my knowledge I am planning to make the site better by extending it with more API, update UI and make it more responsive.
